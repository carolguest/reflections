When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you want to share your work with others, when you want to collaborate, when you want to use multiple computers and save all your files to the cloud.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because I don't want the ground shifting under me too regularly. I may have local changes that conflict with the changes on github and I want to finish working on my change before dealing with those conflicts.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks: An action in github where you copy someone else's repository into your own github account, attributing that fork as you go
Clone: Pulling a github repo onto you local machine or copying a local repo to another spot
Branch: Creating a separate set of commits on your local machine for experiments, etc
